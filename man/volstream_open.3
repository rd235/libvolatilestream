.SH NAME
\f[CB]volstream_open\f[R] \[en] create a FILE* stream as a volatile
stream buffer
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[CB]#include <volatilestream.h>\f[R]
.PP
\f[CB]FILE *volstream_open(void);\f[R]
.PP
\f[CB]int volstream_trunc(FILE *\f[R]\f[I]f\f[R]\f[CB], size_t\f[R]
\f[I]length\f[R]\f[CB]);\f[R]
.PP
\f[CB]int volstream_getbuf(FILE *\f[R]\f[I]f\f[R]\f[CB], void **\f[R]\f[I]buf\f[R]\f[CB], size_t *\f[R]\f[I]buflen\f[R]\f[CB]);\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
A volatile stream is a stdio FILE* stream as a temporary dynamically
allocated (and deallocated) memory buffer.
.PP
The \f[CB]volstream_open\f[R] function opens a stdio stream as a
temporary memory buffer.
The buffer is dynamically allocated, grows as needed and it is
automatically deallocated when the stream is closed.
.PP
\f[CB]volstream_trunc\f[R] truncates the buffer to the requested
\f[I]length\f[R].
If the current size of the buffer is larger than \f[I]length\f[R] the
extra data is lost.
If the buffer is shorter it is extended and the extended part is filled
with null bytes.
.PP
\f[CB]volstream_getbuf\f[R] writes the current address and size of the
buffer in \f[CB]*buf\f[R] and \f[CB]*buflen\f[R] respectively.
These values remain valid only as long as the caller performs no further
output on the stream or the stream is closed.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion \f[CB]volstream_open\f[R] returns a FILE
pointer.
Otherwise, NULL is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.
.PP
\f[CB]volstream_trunc\f[R] and \f[CB]volstream_getbuf\f[R] return 0 or
\-1 if an error occurred.
In the event of an error, errno is set to indicate the error.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following example writes all the command arguments in a volatile
stream, then it rereads the volatile stream one byte at a time:
.IP
.EX
#include *stdio.h*
#include *volatilestream.h*

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  FILE *f = volstream_open();
  int c;
  for (argv++; *argv; argv++)
    fprintf(f, \[dq]%s\[rs]n\[dq], *argv);
  fseek(f, 0, SEEK_SET);
  while ((c = getc(f)) != EOF)
    putchar(c);
  fclose(f);
}
.EE
.PP
The following example has the same effect but it rereads the arguments
as a memory buffer.
.IP
.EX
#include *stdio.h*
#include *unistd.h*
#include *volatilestream.h*

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  FILE *f = volstream_open();
  int c;
  for (argv++; *argv; argv++) {
    fprintf(f, \[dq]%s\[rs]n\[dq], *argv);
  }
  fflush(f);
  ssize_t s;
  void *buf;
  volstream_getbuf(f, &buf, &s);
  write(STDOUT_FILENO, buf, s);
  fclose(f);
}
