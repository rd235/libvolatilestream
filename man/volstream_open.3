.TH "VOLSTREAM_OPEN" "3" "October 2019" "VirtualSquare"
.SH "NAME"
\fBvolstream_open\fR \- create a FILE* stream as a volatile stream buffer
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fB#include <volatilestream\.h>\fR
.P
\fBFILE *volstream_open(void);\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
A volatile stream is a stdio FILE* stream as a temporary dynamically allocated (and deallocated) memory buffer\.
.P
The \fBvolstream_open\fR function opens a stdio stream as a temporary memory buffer\. The buffer is dynamically allocated, grows as needed and it is automatically deallocated when the stream is closed\.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion volstream_open() returns a FILE pointer\. Otherwise, NULL is returned and errno is set to indicate the error\.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
The following example writes all the command arguments in a volatile stream, then it rereads the volatile stream one byte at a time:
.IP "" 4
.nf
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  FILE *f = volstream_open();
  int c;
  for (argv++; *argv; argv++)
    fprintf(f, "%s\en", *argv);
  fseek(f, 0, SEEK_SET);
  while ((c = getc(f)) != EOF)
    putchar(c);
  fclose(f);
}
